# tic_tac_toe

A Simple Flutter application which shows 3 * 3 grid where "X"s and "O"s can be input and shows result in the end
```
 $ flutter pub get
 
 $ flutter run
 ```
 
This App uses the flutter BLoC pattern.

(if you want the app to use vanilla Flutter just change `runApp(BLoCPatternFlutter());` to `runApp(Vanilla());` in the `main.dart` file ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰)
