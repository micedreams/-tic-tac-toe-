# tic_tac_toe

A Simple Flutter application which shows 3 * 3 grid where "X"s and "O"s can be input and shows result in the end
```
 $ flutter pub get
 
 $ flutter run
 ```

 
This App uses the flutter BLoC pattern.

(if you want the app to use vanilla Flutter just change `runApp(BLoCPatternFlutter());` to `runApp(Vanilla());` in the `main.dart` file ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰)

## How I turned my Set state flutter project into BLoC pattern flutter project

1. First I figured out states of my flutter widgits (in this case I just have 1 state..) then I defined the state class 

 ```
 class TicTacToeState {
  final str;
  final result;
  TicTacToeState({this.str, this.result = "reset"});
}
```
 `Abstract Factory Pattern`:if there is more than one state it is good to first define an abstract class 
 then define separate classes for each state and  extend those states to the abstact class so if there is a common methods 
 you can define it in the abstract class..and later override it in the classes that extend it..same thing happens with events. 
 
2. I figured out events that cuase changes in my board.

   My projects has 2 types of events 
    1. reset event: event that can be seen as soon as the app opens or when clicked on reset button to bring it back to the initial state
    2. click event: event that triggers the start of the game... or the next move....
  
 ```
 abstract class TicTacToeEvent {}
 
class ResetEvent extends TicTacToeEvent {}

class ClickEvent extends TicTacToeEvent {
  final int index;
  ClickEvent(this.index);
}
```
3. I imported the [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) library into my project 
4. Defining BLoC Class 
   
   Our BLoC class looks something like this 
   ```
   class TicTacToeBloc extends Bloc<TicTacToeEvent, TicTacToeState> {
      TicTacToeFunctions function = new TicTacToeFunctions();
      var str = List.filled(9, "", growable: false);
      TicTacToeBloc()
         : super(TicTacToeState(str: List.filled(9, "", growable: false))) {
       on<ResetEvent>((event, emit) {
         var dispose = function.dispose();
         str = dispose[0];
         emit(TicTacToeState(str: dispose[0], result: dispose[1]));
       });
       on<ClickEvent>((event, emit) {
         var click = function.click(event.index, str);
         emit(TicTacToeState(str: click[0], result: click[1]));
       });
      }
   }
 
  It has a constructor that takes in an initial value and on<event> functions 
 
  (note: in `on<event>`, event is a string used by the BlocProvider to trigger the specific event defined in the method)
  

7. defined event methods that emits the required state `on<EventClass>((event, emit) {emit();});`
8. to set this all up in main method used the BlocProvider widget giving it the inital state event for its create property 
9. and in View Class in the on pressed button, where set state was being called I replaced it with the BlocProvider's add(event) function 
10. and tada things started to work
